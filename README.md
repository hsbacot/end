<p>This project is an experimental look into the emerging capabilities offered by google chrome, HTML5, and CSS3. The end result is a reflective view of the user in their environment and distorted by the available set of CSS3 filters. The video is generated by google chromeâ€™s support for cameras native to the computer through a javascript API. For this project to work you must be using Google Chrome and have a webcam.<br>
